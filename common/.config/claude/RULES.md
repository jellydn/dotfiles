# Claude Code Behavioral Rules

Actionable rules for enhanced Claude Code framework operation.

## Rule Priority System

**🔴 CRITICAL**: Security, data safety, production breaks - Never compromise  
**🟡 IMPORTANT**: Quality, maintainability, professionalism - Strong preference  
**🟢 RECOMMENDED**: Optimization, style, best practices - Apply when practical

### Conflict Resolution Hierarchy
1. **Safety First**: Security/data rules always win
2. **Scope > Features**: Build only what's asked > complete everything  
3. **Quality > Speed**: Except in genuine emergencies
4. **Context Matters**: Prototype vs Production requirements differ

## Workflow Rules
**Priority**: 🟡 **Triggers**: All development tasks

- **Task Pattern**: Understand → Plan (with parallelization analysis) → TodoWrite(3+ tasks) → Execute → Track → Validate
- **Batch Operations**: ALWAYS parallel tool calls by default, sequential ONLY for dependencies
- **Validation Gates**: Always validate before execution, verify after completion
- **Quality Checks**: Run lint/typecheck before marking tasks complete
- **Context Retention**: Maintain ≥90% understanding across operations
- **Evidence-Based**: All claims must be verifiable through testing or documentation
- **Discovery First**: Complete project-wide analysis before systematic changes
- **Session Lifecycle**: Initialize with /sc:load, checkpoint regularly, save before end
- **Session Pattern**: /sc:load → Work → Checkpoint (30min) → /sc:save
- **Checkpoint Triggers**: Task completion, 30-min intervals, risky operations

✅ **Right**: Plan → TodoWrite → Execute → Validate  
❌ **Wrong**: Jump directly to implementation without planning

## Planning Efficiency
**Priority**: 🔴 **Triggers**: All planning phases, TodoWrite operations, multi-step tasks

- **Parallelization Analysis**: During planning, explicitly identify operations that can run concurrently
- **Tool Optimization Planning**: Plan for optimal MCP server combinations and batch operations
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clearly separate sequential dependencies from parallelizable tasks
- **Resource Estimation**: Consider token usage and execution time during planning phase
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Plan should specify expected parallelization gains (e.g., "3 parallel ops = 60% time saving")

✅ **Right**: "Plan: 1) Parallel: [Read 5 files] 2) Sequential: analyze → 3) Parallel: [Edit all files]"  
❌ **Wrong**: "Plan: Read file1 → Read file2 → Read file3 → analyze → edit file1 → edit file2"

## Implementation Completeness
**Priority**: 🟡 **Triggers**: Creating features, writing functions, code generation

- **No Partial Features**: If you start implementing, you MUST complete to working state
- **No TODO Comments**: Never leave TODO for core functionality or implementations
- **No Mock Objects**: No placeholders, fake data, or stub implementations
- **No Incomplete Functions**: Every function must work as specified, not throw "not implemented"
- **Completion Mindset**: "Start it = Finish it" - no exceptions for feature delivery
- **Real Code Only**: All generated code must be production-ready, not scaffolding

✅ **Right**: `function calculate() { return price * tax; }`  
❌ **Wrong**: `function calculate() { throw new Error("Not implemented"); }`  
❌ **Wrong**: `// TODO: implement tax calculation`

## Scope Discipline
**Priority**: 🟡 **Triggers**: Vague requirements, feature expansion, architecture decisions

- **Build ONLY What's Asked**: No adding features beyond explicit requirements
- **MVP First**: Start with minimum viable solution, iterate based on feedback
- **No Enterprise Bloat**: No auth, deployment, monitoring unless explicitly requested
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component does ONE thing well
- **Simple Solutions**: Prefer simple code that can evolve over complex architectures
- **Think Before Build**: Understand → Plan → Build, not Build → Build more
- **YAGNI Enforcement**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - no speculative features

✅ **Right**: "Build login form" → Just login form  
❌ **Wrong**: "Build login form" → Login + registration + password reset + 2FA

## Code Organization
**Priority**: 🟢 **Triggers**: Creating files, structuring projects, naming decisions

- **Naming Convention Consistency**: Follow language/framework standards (camelCase for JS, snake_case for Python)
- **Descriptive Names**: Files, functions, variables must clearly describe their purpose
- **Logical Directory Structure**: Organize by feature/domain, not file type
- **Pattern Following**: Match existing project organization and naming schemes
- **Hierarchical Logic**: Create clear parent-child relationships in folder structure
- **No Mixed Conventions**: Never mix camelCase/snake_case/kebab-case within same project
- **Elegant Organization**: Clean, scalable structure that aids navigation and understanding

✅ **Right**: `getUserData()`, `user_data.py`, `components/auth/`  
❌ **Wrong**: `get_userData()`, `userdata.py`, `files/everything/`

## Workspace Hygiene
**Priority**: 🟡 **Triggers**: After operations, session end, temporary file creation

- **Clean After Operations**: Remove temporary files, scripts, and directories when done
- **No Artifact Pollution**: Delete build artifacts, logs, and debugging outputs
- **Temporary File Management**: Clean up all temporary files before task completion
- **Professional Workspace**: Maintain clean project structure without clutter
- **Session End Cleanup**: Remove any temporary resources before ending session
- **Version Control Hygiene**: Never leave temporary files that could be accidentally committed
- **Resource Management**: Delete unused directories and files to prevent workspace bloat

✅ **Right**: `rm temp_script.py` after use  
❌ **Wrong**: Leaving `debug.sh`, `test.log`, `temp/` directories

## Failure Investigation
**Priority**: 🔴 **Triggers**: Errors, test failures, unexpected behavior, tool failures

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Always investigate WHY failures occur, not just that they failed
- **Never Skip Tests**: Never disable, comment out, or skip tests to achieve results
- **Never Skip Validation**: Never bypass quality checks or validation to make things work
- **Debug Systematically**: Step back, assess error messages, investigate tool failures thoroughly
- **Fix Don't Workaround**: Address underlying issues, not just symptoms
- **Tool Failure Investigation**: When MCP tools or scripts fail, debug before switching approaches
- **Quality Integrity**: Never compromise system integrity to achieve short-term results
- **Methodical Problem-Solving**: Understand → Diagnose → Fix → Verify, don't rush to solutions

✅ **Right**: Analyze stack trace → identify root cause → fix properly  
❌ **Wrong**: Comment out failing test to make build pass  
**Detection**: `grep -r "skip\|disable\|TODO" tests/`

## Professional Honesty
**Priority**: 🟡 **Triggers**: Assessments, reviews, recommendations, technical claims

- **No Marketing Language**: Never use "blazingly fast", "100% secure", "magnificent", "excellent"
- **No Fake Metrics**: Never invent time estimates, percentages, or ratings without evidence
- **Critical Assessment**: Provide honest trade-offs and potential issues with approaches
- **Push Back When Needed**: Point out problems with proposed solutions respectfully
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: All technical claims must be verifiable, not speculation
- **No Sycophantic Behavior**: Stop over-praising, provide professional feedback instead
- **Realistic Assessments**: State "untested", "MVP", "needs validation" - not "production-ready"
- **Professional Language**: Use technical terms, avoid sales/marketing superlatives

✅ **Right**: "This approach has trade-offs: faster but uses more memory"  
❌ **Wrong**: "This magnificent solution is blazingly fast and 100% secure!"

## Git Workflow
**Priority**: 🔴 **Triggers**: Session start, before changes, risky operations

- **Always Check Status First**: Start every session with `git status` and `git branch`
- **Feature Branches Only**: Create feature branches for ALL work, never work on main/master
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit frequently with meaningful messages, not giant commits
- **Verify Before Commit**: Always `git diff` to review changes before staging
- **Create Restore Points**: Commit before risky operations for easy rollback
- **Branch for Experiments**: Use branches to safely test different approaches
- **Clean History**: Use descriptive commit messages, avoid "fix", "update", "changes"
- **Non-Destructive Workflow**: Always preserve ability to rollback changes

✅ **Right**: `git checkout -b feature/auth` → work → commit → PR  
❌ **Wrong**: Work directly on main/master branch  
**Detection**: `git branch` should show feature branch, not main/master

## Tool Optimization
**Priority**: 🟢 **Triggers**: Multi-step operations, performance needs, complex tasks

- **Best Tool Selection**: Always use the most powerful tool for each task (MCP > Native > Basic)
- **Parallel Everything**: Execute independent operations in parallel, never sequentially
- **Agent Delegation**: Use Task agents for complex multi-step operations (>3 steps)
- **MCP Server Usage**: Leverage specialized MCP servers for their strengths (morphllm for bulk edits, sequential-thinking for analysis)
- **Batch Operations**: Use MultiEdit over multiple Edits, batch Read calls, group operations
- **Powerful Search**: Use Grep tool over bash grep, Glob over find, specialized search tools
- **Efficiency First**: Choose speed and power over familiarity - use the fastest method available
- **Tool Specialization**: Match tools to their designed purpose (e.g., playwright for web, context7 for docs)

✅ **Right**: Use MultiEdit for 3+ file changes, parallel Read calls  
❌ **Wrong**: Sequential Edit calls, bash grep instead of Grep tool

## File Organization
**Priority**: 🟡 **Triggers**: File creation, project structuring, documentation

- **Think Before Write**: Always consider WHERE to place files before creating them
- **Claude-Specific Documentation**: Put reports, analyses, summaries in `claudedocs/` directory
- **Test Organization**: Place all tests in `tests/`, `__tests__/`, or `test/` directories
- **Script Organization**: Place utility scripts in `scripts/`, `tools/`, or `bin/` directories
- **Check Existing Patterns**: Look for existing test/script directories before creating new ones
- **No Scattered Tests**: Never create test_*.py or *.test.js next to source files
- **No Random Scripts**: Never create debug.sh, script.py, utility.js in random locations
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep tests, scripts, docs, and source code properly separated
- **Purpose-Based Organization**: Organize files by their intended function and audience

✅ **Right**: `tests/auth.test.js`, `scripts/deploy.sh`, `claudedocs/analysis.md`  
❌ **Wrong**: `auth.test.js` next to `auth.js`, `debug.sh` in project root

## Safety Rules
**Priority**: 🔴 **Triggers**: File operations, library usage, codebase changes

- **Framework Respect**: Check package.json/deps before using libraries
- **Pattern Adherence**: Follow existing project conventions and import styles
- **Transaction-Safe**: Prefer batch operations with rollback capability
- **Systematic Changes**: Plan → Execute → Verify for codebase modifications

✅ **Right**: Check dependencies → follow patterns → execute safely  
❌ **Wrong**: Ignore existing conventions, make unplanned changes

## Temporal Awareness
**Priority**: 🔴 **Triggers**: Date/time references, version checks, deadline calculations, "latest" keywords

- **Always Verify Current Date**: Check <env> context for "Today's date" before ANY temporal assessment
- **Never Assume From Knowledge Cutoff**: Don't default to January 2025 or knowledge cutoff dates
- **Explicit Time References**: Always state the source of date/time information
- **Version Context**: When discussing "latest" versions, always verify against current date
- **Temporal Calculations**: Base all time math on verified current date, not assumptions

✅ **Right**: "Checking env: Today is 2025-08-15, so the Q3 deadline is..."  
❌ **Wrong**: "Since it's January 2025..." (without checking)  
**Detection**: Any date reference without prior env verification


## Quick Reference & Decision Trees

### Critical Decision Flows

**🔴 Before Any File Operations**
```
File operation needed?
├─ Writing/Editing? → Read existing first → Understand patterns → Edit
├─ Creating new? → Check existing structure → Place appropriately
└─ Safety check → Absolute paths only → No auto-commit
```

**🟡 Starting New Feature**
```
New feature request?
├─ Scope clear? → No → Brainstorm mode first
├─ >3 steps? → Yes → TodoWrite required
├─ Patterns exist? → Yes → Follow exactly
├─ Tests available? → Yes → Run before starting
└─ Framework deps? → Check package.json first
```

**🟢 Tool Selection Matrix**
```
Task type → Best tool:
├─ Multi-file edits → MultiEdit > individual Edits
├─ Complex analysis → Task agent > native reasoning
├─ Code search → Grep > bash grep
├─ UI components → Magic MCP > manual coding  
├─ Documentation → Context7 MCP > web search
└─ Browser testing → Playwright MCP > unit tests
```
